Security Whitelisting Information for rpmlint-checks
====================================================

In openSUSE [rpmlint-checks](https://github.com/openSUSE/rpmlint-checks) are
used for performing quality assurance on RPM packages. An important part of
these checks are security related and managed by the [SUSE security
team](https://www.suse.com/support/security/).

This repository here is used to administer whitelisting information consumed
by the rpmlint-mini package to actually implement whitelisting restriction on
certain packaging features.

The maintainer of this repository is the SUSE [security
team](mailto:security@suse.com).
